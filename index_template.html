<h2> Chandra Aimpoint Trending</h2>

<p>The observation aimpoint is defined as the position on the focal plane where an on-axis
target is located, assuming that the SIM offset is zero and both Y Offset and Z Offset
(aimpoint offset) are zero.  Over the course of the mission the mean aimpoint has drifted
over 30 arcsec, due primarily due to the steadily increasing temperature of the Aspect
Camera Assembly (ACA).  See the <a href="#details">Details</a>
and <a href="#references">References</a> sections for further information.

<p>In addition to a mean drift there has been a steady increase in the scatter on time
scales of days.  This term is directly related to the absolute pointing
accuracy which describes the positional accuracy with which a target can be placed on the
detector.  Starting around 2015 the amplitude of this scatter has been large enough to
potentially impact "pointing-sensitive" observations in which an absolute pointing error
might affect science or instrument safety.  This includes ACIS windowed or subarray
observations, or grating observations of unusually bright sources that must be kept just
off the detector.

<p> The mean aimpoint drift adds to pointing uncertainty by introducing a discrepancy
between the <em>predicted</em> median aimpoint (used in the planning process) and the
actual median aimpoint around the time of observation.  The predicted aimpoint for
each detector fixed at a preset value since cycle 18 (2017) as stated in the
<a href="http://cxc.harvard.edu/proposer/POG/html/">Proposers' Observatory Guide</a>.

The temperature-dependent ACA alignment shift is compensated by means of a
dynamical pointing offset that is introduced into the planning process. See the
<a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/115aq7B2_TuieA3iu82cxKlEYsWUiqZ7df8jYP37qrq4/edit?usp=sharing">

<h3>Legacy aimpoint monitor page and details</h3>

For the historical version of the aimpoint trending page that was used as the
basis for understanding the aimpoint issue and developing the dynamical offsets
concept, see the <a href="https://cxc.harvard.edu/mta/ASPECT/aimpoint_mon/">
Legacy aimpoint monitor</a> page. That page is no longer being updated, but
includes key details of processing that are still relevant.

<h3> Observed aimpoint differences trend </h3>

The following plot shows the difference in CHIPX and CHIPY between the planned observation
aimpoint and the actual aimpoint.  The planned aimpoint is computed using the planned
aimpoint chip coordinates (CHIPX/Y) and observer target offsets and the SIM-Z position.
The actual aimpoint is computed using <tt>dmcoords</tt> and keyword values from the CXC
archive L2 X-ray event file.  The plot shows up to 6 months of data starting from when
dynamic aimpoints were initially put into use (AUG2916 schedule).

The data values are stored in the observed aimpoints table
(<a href="observed_aimpoints_table.html">HTML</a>
or <a href="observed_aimpoints.dat">ASCII</a>).

<h3> Intra-observation aimpoint drift </h3>

During an observation the aimpoint can drift, and this is illustrated in the plot below.
However, from the perspective of planning observations this need not be
considered because it is <em>already included</em> in the <a href="#aimpoint-trending">Aimpoint
  Trending</a> plots.  This is because those plots sample from 1 ksec intervals within
every science observation (instead of per-observation means), thus picking up the extremes.

<h3>ACA housing temperature</h3>
<p>The trend of ACA housing temperature is shown below, and one easily sees the qualitative similarity
    with the aimpoint trending data.<br/>
