          <h2> <font color="#990000">Fiducial light drift</font></h2>

          This page shows the drift of fiducial light positions over the course
          of the mission.  Since launch, there has been a drift
          of about 12 arcsec along both spacecraft Y and Z.
          This apparent drift in position can be due to a combination of any of the
          following factors:
          <ul>
            <li> Shifting ACA alignment
            <li> Physical shift of the SIM relative to the OBA
            <li> Bending of the OBA
            <li> Alignment drift in the FTS
          </ul>

          The first three factors are nearly degenerate, and could only be
          distinguished by determining if the X-ray PSF of sources at the nominal
          aimpoint has degraded due to the 9 arcsec drift.

          Only the last factor (FTS alignment drift) produces a change in the
          boresight calibration (i.e. celestial location offset).  Based on the
          time history of the <a
            href="http://cxc.harvard.edu/mta/ASPECT/boresight/UPDATE_2002-Apr/">
            boresight alignment</a>, the FTS alignment has drifted 2.7 arcsec in the
          Y-axis and -1.2 arcsec in the Z-axis.

          <h4> Fid light drifts (Updated <!--#CONFIG TIMEFMT="%x"--><!--#flastmod file="drift_model_y.png"-->)</h4>

          The data for these plots were generated by extracting Aspect L1
          centroid data and fid properties data for all archived observations.
          The last 4 ksec of data are used, to minimize scatter due to thermal
          transients.  Then a median centroid position is calculated for each
          fid light.  Finally, for each science instrument and fid light, the
          "drift" is calculated by removing both the mean centroid for that fid
          light (over observations in early 2003) and the SIM-Z offset (for
          that observation).

          In the plots below, different colors and symbols represent the different fid
          lights for each SI.

          <h4> Fid light commanded search position versus telemetry
            (Updated <!--#CONFIG TIMEFMT="%x"--><!--#flastmod file="starcheck_telem.png"-->)</h4>

          The data for this plot represents the difference in Y and Z between
          the commanded search position for fids and the actual observed location.
          The red dashed line represents the fid light search box half-width, at which
          point the likelihood of a failed fid acquisition is high.  Within the green
          dashed region (15 arcsec half-width) the likelihood of failure is low.

          <h4> ACA CCD cooldown in late 2006</h4>

          Starting around 2006:320 there is a strong trend in the fid light
          positions, primarily in the minus-Y direction.  Over an interval of
          about 40 days the alignment has drifted approximately -8 arcsec in Y
          and -4 arcsec in Z.  This coincides with the ACA cooldown from -15 C
          to -20 C and it is very likely that the additional heat generated by
          the CCD TEC is responsible for the alignment change.

          <h4> Sharp shift around Jul-2003 </h4> Near Jul-2003 there is a
          sharp shift in alignment of nearly 6 arcsec.  This is associated
          with the swap from IRU-1 to IRU-2, and is discussed in detail in
          the <a

            drift during IRU swap and ACA cooldown</a> document.
